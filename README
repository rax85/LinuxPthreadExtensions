=========================
Linux PThread Extensions.
=========================

This library provides some functionality that I thought would be a nice
addition to the stock pthread library. 

I. This is a list of currently available and planned functionality:
    1. Thread Pools.
        - Fixed sized thread pools are minimally tested.
        - Variable sized thread pools are minimally tested.
        - Group execution of threads. Same callback, multiple threads [Planned].
        - Barriers are implemented and minimally tested.
    
    2. Semaphores.
        - The blocking semaphore is implemented and minimally tested. This is
          built entirely using pthread routines and not posix semaphores.
        - Timed semaphores are implemented and minimally tested.
    
    3. Memory pools
        - Memory pools with support for fixed sized allocation are implemented and minimally tested.
        - Memory pools with support for variable sized allocation [Coded - Untested].

II. Building.
    - 'make' builds the library.
    - 'make documentation' builds doxygen documentation. You need doxygen for this
      target to build.
    - 'make test' builds test.out a binary that runs a few simple tests.

III. Linking notes.
    - While linking against your program, be sure to also link against -lpthread and -lrt

Keep checking back for developments!
