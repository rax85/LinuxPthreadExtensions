Linux PThread Extensions.

This library provides some functionality that I thought would be a nice
addition to the stock pthread library. 

This is a list of currently available functionality:
1. Thread Pools.
    - Fixed sized thread pools are minimally tested.
    - Variable sized thread pools are coded up but are not tested.

2. Semaphores.
    - The blocking semaphore is implemented and minimally tested. This is
      built entirely using pthread routines and not posix semaphores.
    - Timed semaphore locks are not yet implemented.

* 'make' builds the library.
* 'make documentation' builds doxygen documentation. You need doxygen for this
  target to build.
* 'make test' builds test.out a binary that runs a few simple tests.

Keep checking back for developments!
